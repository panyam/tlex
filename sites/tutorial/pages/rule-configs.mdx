# A simple example

By default when rules are added to the tokenizer they are matched in the order in which they are specified.

For example in the following config:

```ts snippet=1 silent=true
  import * as TLEX from "tlex";
  const tokenizer = new TLEX.Tokenizer()
                  .add("hello")
                  .add("world")
                  .add(/\s+/)
                  .add(/h.*o/);
```

matching:

```ts snippet=2 prev=1 silent=true
  console.log(tokenizer.tokenize("hello hello"));
```

would yield the following tokens:

```snipout src=2
```

Notice the matchIndex - denoting the rule that matched.  Both (non-space) tokens have a matchIndex of 0 (instead of the longer 3 corresponding to "h.*o").

# Configuring rules

The add method on the tokenizer takes the following parameters:
