# Welcome to TLEX
 
*tlex* is a powerful, flexible and incremental lexical analyzer generator used for creating lexers.  When parsing a programming language, lexical anaylsis is the first phase (of many) in converting a high level input/program into a sequence of tokens.  Unlike traditional lexical analyzers tlex allows updating the token stream incrementally when changes to the input text have been made.
