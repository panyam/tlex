# Configuring Rules

By default when rules are added to the tokenizer they are matched in the order in which they are specified.

For example in the following config:

```ts
  import * as TLEX from "tlex";
  const tokenizer = new TLEX.Tokenizer()
                  .add("hello")
                  .add("h.*o");
  console.log(tokenizer.tokenize("hellohello"));
```

The following would match "hello" instead of the entire string even the latter is valid and a longer match:

```ts
  console.log("Another hello world")
```

<h3>Testing</h3>

How rules are matched can be configured by the second parameter to the add method.  The add method takes 3 parameters:

* `pattern`: A regex or string representing the regex for the rule.
* `config`: A RuleConfig object
* `onMatch`: A callback to be invokved then the rule has matched.  This gives the option
