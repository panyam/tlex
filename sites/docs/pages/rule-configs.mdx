# Configuring Rules

By default when rules are added to the tokenizer they are matched in the order in which they are specified.

For example in the following config:

```ts
tokenizer = new TLEX.Tokenizer();

tokenizer.add("hello")
         .add("h.*o");
```

The following would match "hello" instead of the entire string even the latter is valid and a longer match:

```
tokenizer.tokenizeAll("hellohello");

// Returns ["hello", "hello"] instead of ["hellohello"]
```

How rules are matched can be configured by the second parameter to the add method.  The add method takes 3 parameters:

* `pattern`: A regex or string representing the regex for the rule.
* `config`: A RuleConfig object
* `onMatch`: A callback to be invokved then the rule has matched.  This gives the option 
\param a
\param b
\param c
